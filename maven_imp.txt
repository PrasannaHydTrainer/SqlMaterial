Maven is a build tool, that which allows you to create any java project as console or windows or framework based. 

If you want to overcome the problem of adding jar files to the given project, then we need the help of maven. 

Instead of adding jar files, we need to add the dependencies to the given project. 

how to create a maven project 

mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.hexaware.trainer -DartifactId=MavenDemo -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 -DinteractiveMode=false

Once you make a maven project, we have 2 sections avaialble as

main
test

main contains the actual business logic
test contains the relevant test cases available. 

to compile the maven project, 

given the command as

mvn compile

to execute any java program

mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.hexaware.trainer.App

maven resources will be available in repositories. 

There are various repositories as


1) Local Repository : Once you create any maven project, all repositories will be stored in local repository called c:\users\user_name\.m2 folder 



2) Central Repository

3) Remote Repostitory 


How the way the maven project gets executed ???


First you run the maven project, first it scans all the content of the pom.xml (project Object Model) 

then it checks for all dependencies from local repository first, if it is avaiable in local repo, fine, else it 

will switch to central repository "maven-archetype-quickstart", this is software available in your system. If 
it is not available then it checks in remote repository (website)
