1) What is the definition of first normal form 

A table said to be in 1NF, when each cell contains precisely one value (Atomic Values). 

2) What is the definition of second normal form 

A table said to be in 1NF, every attribute functionally depend on whole key but not part of the key (functional dependency) 

3) What is the definition of third normal form 

A table said to be in 2NF, every attribute needs to depend on whole key but not transitively (Transitive Dependency) 

4) Which keyword allows you to remove duplicate entries at the time of display

DISTINCT

5) what would be output of 

   select count(comm) from Emp

Display count of rows for which comm column is not null. 

Means how many not null rows avaialble for comm column will be displayed. 

6) What would be output for 

select Empno, Ename, job, sal from emp having basic > 2000;

-- query is wrong, we need to use WHERE clause here instead of HAVING

7) What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses 

WHERE clause used to filter records based on table fields, where
HAVING clause used to filter records based on aggregate fields. 

Having always expects aggregate condition.

8) What is the output for the given query. 

select Job,Count(*) from Emp
group by Job;

-- Displays no.of employees are working in each dept (job) 

9) What is the output for the given query 

select job,count(*) from emp 
group by job
where job in('CLERK','MANAGER','SALESMAN');

-- Query returns an error, as WHERE clause always before group by 

The correct query is 

select job,count(*) from emp 
where job in('CLERK','MANAGER','SALESMAN');
group by job


10) What would be output for the below query

select Job,Count(*) from Emp
group by Job
having count(*) > 1;

-- Displays no.of employees are working in each dept (job), as which dept (job) 
contains more than 1 employ

11) What is the output for the below query 

select Job,Count(*) from Emp
order by job
group by Job
having count(*) > 1;

-- The query throws error, as Order By Clause always comes at end, correct query is 

select Job,Count(*) from Emp
group by Job
having count(*) > 1
order by job;

-- Priority Order 

Where -> Group By -> Having -> order By 

12) What would be output for the given query 

select Empno,Ename,job,sal from emp
order by 4;


13) Can you join a table with itself 

Yes (self join)

14) Which join generates cartician product to table records 

Cross Join

15) 

Create table EmpTest
(
   Empno INT ,
   Name varchar(30),
   Sal numeric(9,2)
)

For the above table, rewrite by adding primary key on Empno field. 

Create table EmpTest
(
   Empno INT ,
   Name varchar(30),
   Sal numeric(9,2),  
   primary key(empno)
)


16) What is meant by Referencial Integrity 

Values of the foreign key needs to match with corresponding primary key values

17) What is the difference between Inner join and OUTER Join 

Inner join displays only matching records, where outer join displays matching/unmatching records

18) If a subquery returns more than one value, we can handle them by using
